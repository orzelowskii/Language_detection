EN From Romania to France. For divination purposes
The Bible has lost its relevance. What will come to us?
for example from the following verse when carelessly
It will open on a Friday in April or in December
Wednesday: “All the vessels of the tabernacle for all the service
in it, and all its stakes, and all the stakes of the court, shall be of brass (Exodus 27:19).* How would we

Croak. He looked at me defiantly and said:
- Please, suggest something
another.
Nothing came to mind. Then he pulled it out
from his backpack a thin, worn book,
he opened it at a random place and then his face
it brightened up for him.
— “Instead of paying attention to the faces of passersby, I looked at their feet and reduced all these busy people to hurrying steps
— but towards what. And it seemed clear to me that our mission was to kick up dust in search of one
a frivolous secret," he read with satisfaction.
Kunicki. Water I
The time is in the morning, he doesn't know exactly
who, he didn't look at his watch, but waits no longer,
more than a quarter of an hour, I think. He leans comfortably against the seat-

no and closes his eyes; the silence is piercing as tall
relentless sound, unable to gather thoughts. Still
he doesn't know it sounds like an alarm. He pushes the seat away from the steering wheel and stretches his legs. His head is heavy, his body follows
its weight, it falls into the white hot air. NO
he will move, he will wait.
He definitely smoked a cigarette, maybe even two. After
A few minutes later he got out of the car and peed in a ditch.
No car seems to have passed him, but now
he's not sure. Then he went back inside and drank water from a plastic bottle. Finally he started to get impatient. He honked his horn violently, and the deafening sound accelerated the wave of anger that came crashing down upon him
kind of down to earth. From that point on, it's all over
he sees more clearly: he followed them along the path, carelessly
imagining in his mind the words he was about to say: "What the hell are you doing?"
Damn, you've been doing this for so long? What are you doing?".
This is an olive grove, parched to the point of pepper. Grass
crunches under shoes. Wild blackberries grow among the twisted olive trees; young shoots try to slip in
to the path and grab his leg. It's everywhere
garbage: tissues, disgusting sanitary pads, fly-infested human excrement
Others also stop by the road to relieve themselves.
They don't bother going deeper into the bushes, they're in a hurry, even here.
There is no wind. There is no sun. White still
the sky resembles the covering of a tent. It's muggy. Water particles are pushed around in the air and everywhere
you can smell the sea - electric, ozone, fishy.

He sees movement, but not there, between the trees, only
here, under your feet. A huge one comes out onto the path
black beetle; he examines the air with his antennae for a moment, then stops, apparently aware of the human presence. The white sky is reflected in its perfect milky armor

a strange eye that does not belong to him is looking at him
no body, a self-willed and disinterested eye. Kunicki lightly nudges the ground with the toe of his sandal. Beetle
runs along the path, rustling on the dry grass.
Disappears in the blackberries. That's all.
Kunicki, cursing, returns to the car and on the way he hopes that she and the boy will be together again
they came back in a roundabout way, yes, he is sure of it. He will say
them: "I've been looking for you for an hour! What the hell are you doing?"
She said, "Stop the car." When he stopped, she got out and opened the back door. She unbuckled the little one
from the car seat, she took his hand and they went together. Kunicki
he didn't feel like going out, he felt sleepy and tired, even though they had only traveled a few kilometers. He looked
only at them out of the corner of his eye, carelessly, he didn't know
that he should look. Now he is trying to evoke this blurred image, sharpen it, zoom in and freeze it. So he sees
them as they walk along the creaky path, from behind. She's probably wearing light linen pants and a black T-shirt, kid
— a T-shirt with an elephant, but he knows that
because he put it on him in the morning. As they walk, they say something to each other, he doesn't hear what, he didn't know he should listen. They disappear

between olives. He doesn't know how long it takes, but it won't be long. A quarter of an hour, maybe a little more, gets lost in time,
he didn't look at his watch. He didn't know he was supposed to check the time. He hated it when she asked him this question:
"What are you thinking about?" He replied, nothing but him
she didn't believe it. She said you couldn't help but think, she was offended. Yes, Kunicki feels something like that now
satisfaction - can not think about anything. He can do it.
But then he suddenly stops in the middle of the blackberry bush, still, as if his body was reaching out for
blackberry rhizomes, involuntarily found a new point of balance. The silence is accompanied by the buzzing of flies and noise
in head. For a moment, he sees himself from above: a man
in plain safari pants, in a white T-shirt,
with a small bald spot on the top of his head, among clumps of bushes,
an intruder, a guest in someone else's house. A man exposed to fire, released in the middle of the moment

leg, force yourself to move. Take a step - he didn't think
that it's so hard; the links broke. The foot in the sandal is the anchor that holds him to the ground, stuck.
Consciously, with effort, surprised by himself, he forces
her to move. There is no other way to leave
this hot, boundless space.
They arrived on August 14. The ferry from Split was full
people - a lot of tourists, but most of them locals.

They brought their purchases with them from the mainland, it's cheaper there. Islands give birth scantily. It was easy to tell the tourists apart because
as the sun began to sink inexorably into the sea,
they moved to the starboard side and aimed at them with their lenses.
The ferry slowly passed the scattered islands and then seemed to emerge into the open sea. An unpleasant feeling, a very brief, frivolous moment of panic.
They found their guesthouse easily, it was called
"Poseidon". The owner, a bearded Branko, in a T-shirt with a seashell, told me to call him by his name and patted

agave - the flower stood on a strong stem and stood triumphant
it rose above the water.
He pulls out a map of the island and considers his options. She could
lose orientation and just go out onto the road in another one
place. It's probably somewhere else now, maybe even
stop a car and go - where? He sees
on the map that the road to Vis leads in a winding line through
the entire island and that you can drive it around, never
going down to the sea. This is how they visited Vis a few days ago. He puts the map on her seat, on her purse,
and sets off. He drives slowly, looking for them among the olive trees. But after about a kilometer the landscape changes:
3 4
the olive grove gives way to a stony wasteland
covered with dry grass and blackberries. White limestone
the stones are bared like huge teeth lost by a wild creature. It turns back after a few kilometers. To his right he now sees stunning green vineyards, with small stone vineyards dotting them every now and then
tool huts - empty and gloomy. At best, she got lost, but maybe she fainted, she
or small, it's so stuffy, so hot. Maybe they need immediate help and instead of doing something, he drives up and down the road. Oh yes, he's stupid
that he understood it only now. He starts getting stronger
heartbeat. Maybe she had sunstroke. Or she broke it
leg.
He comes back and honks his horn a few times. They're passing by
two German cars. Checks the time; it's been less now
more than an hour and a half, which means the ferry has left.
It swallowed the cars, closed the gates and headed out to sea, a powerful white ship. They divide from minute to minute
their ever-widening expanses of indifferent sea. Kunicki
he has a black premonition that makes his tongue dry,
a premonition of something to do with this garbage
on the road, with flies and human excrement. He understood. They died. They're both gone. He knows he doesn't have it
them among the olive trees, but nevertheless it runs dry there
down the path and calls out to them, no longer believing that they will answer.
It's afternoon siesta time, the town is almost here
empty. On the beach, just off the road, three women are flying a blue kite. He sees them exactly when

parks. One of them has light cream pants that hug her thick buttocks.
He finds Branek at a table in a small cafe.
He's sitting there with two other men. They drink palinkac with ice, like whiskey. Branko smiles
at the sight of him, surprised.
— Have you forgotten something? - he asks.
They offer him a chair, but he doesn't sit down. I want
tell everything one by one, switches to English, and at the same time somewhere in another part of his head he wonders, as if it were a movie, what one does in such a
situation. He says that they died, Jagoda and the little one. He says where
and when. He says he looked and didn't find it. Then Branko
asks:
-Did you have a fight?
He replies no, truthfully. Two men finish their palinka drinks. He would like to, too.
I feel this spicy-sweet taste in my mouth. Branko slowly collects a pack of cigarettes and a lighter from the table.
The others get up too, reluctantly, as if they were concentrating
before the fight, or maybe they would just rather sit here
in the shade of the awning. Everyone will go there, except Kunicki
insists that the police must be notified first.
Branko hesitates. His black beard is streaked with gray hair. On the yellow T-shirt there is a red drawing of a shell and the inscription: "Shell".
— Maybe she went down to the sea?
Maybe she came down. They agree: Branko and Kunicki will return
to that place, and the other two will go to the police station to call Visu. Branko explains that

there is only one policeman in Komiža, a real one
the police station is in Visa. The glasses are left on the table
with melting ice.
Kunicki easily recognizes a small bay at...

horn.
The sound is long, plaintive, like the voice of an animal.
It falls silent and breaks into miniature echoes of cicadas.
They set off into the olive bush, calling to each other from time to time. They meet only at the vineyard and after
moment of conversation, they decide to go through it all. They move in shadowy rows, calling the missing woman: "Jagoda, Jagoda!" Kunicki realizes the meaning of this name, he has already forgotten about it
and suddenly it seems to him that he is taking part in an ancient one
ritual, blurry, grotesque. From under the bushes
swollen dark purple clusters hang, perverse, multiplied nipples, and he wanders in the leafy
labyrinths, shouting: "Jagoda, Jagoda". Who is it for?
Who is he looking for?
He has to stop for a moment, it stings his side; it bends in half between the rows of plants. He submerges his head
in the shady coolness, Branek's voice, muffled by the leaves, falls silent and Kunicki now hears the buzzing of flies
— a familiar fabric of silence.

Behind the vineyard, another one begins, separated only
narrow path. They stop and Branko calls on his cell phone. He repeats the two words "żena" and "dijete" - only
Kunicki can understand this. The sun turns orange; large, swollen and weakening in the eyes.
In a moment you will be able to look him in the face. The vineyards take on an intensely dark green color.
Two human figurines stand in this green striped one
helplessly in the sea.
At dusk, there are already a few cars and a group of people on the road
men. Kunicki is sitting in a car with a sign
"Policija" and with Branek's help he answers what he thinks are chaotic questions from a big, sweaty policeman. He speaks simple English. "We stopped. She
went out with the child. They went right, here," he points with his hand. "I was waiting, let's say, fifteen minutes.
Then I decided to go and look for them. And couldn't
find them. I didn't know what has happened." He is given warm mineral water and drinks it greedily.
"They are lost." And then he adds again: "lost."
A policeman is calling from somewhere on his cell phone. "It's impossible
"to be lost here, my friend," she tells him, waiting
per call. Kunicki is struck by "my friend". Then the walkie-talkie rings. Before they start driving along the rough road
in a row into the interior of the island, another hour will pass.
During this time, the swollen sun descends over
vineyards, and when they reach the very top, it turns out that it already touches the sea. Involuntarily, they witness the operatic extension of his sunset. Eventually people light up

flashlights. Already in the dark they descend to a high, rugged mountain
the shore of the island, full of small bays, and check two of them, each with stone houses,
inhabited by those more eccentric tourists who don't like hotels and prefer to pay more
for the lack of running water and electricity. People cook
on stone kitchens or have cylinders with them
with gas. They catch fish that come straight from the sea
on the grill. No, no one saw a woman with a child.
They're about to eat dinner - they appear on the tables
bread, cheese, olives and poor fish, which were still engaged in their mindless activities at noon
in the sea. From time to time Branko calls the hotel
in Komiža - Kunicki asks him for it, because he gives it to him
It turned out that she got lost and ended up getting there by a different route. But Branko pats him after every call
only on the back.
Around midnight it turns out that a group of men
melted and among them are the two whom Kunicki saw at the table in Komiža. Now, at
saying goodbye, they introduce themselves: Drago and Roman. They're coming
together to the car. Kunicki is grateful to them
help, he doesn't know how to show it, he forgot how to say it
in Croatian you say "thank you"; it must be "djakuju", "djakuje" or something like that. Actually
with a bit of good will, they could work together to develop some kind of Slavic koine, a set of similar,
handy Slavic words, used without grammar, instead of falling into a dull and simplified
English version.

At night, a boat arrives at his house. They're doing fine
evacuate, it's a flood. The water is already at one o'clock
floors of buildings. In the kitchen, it squeezes through the joints between the tiles and flows out in warm streams
from electrical sockets. The books swollen from moisture.
He opens one and sees that the letters are flowing like makeup,
leaving blank blurred pages. It turns out,
that everyone had already left on the previous transport,
only he remained.
In his sleep, he hears drops of water falling lazily from the sky, which after a while turns violent
short downpour.

Kunicki. Water II
“The island isn't that big,” he says in the morning
Djurdzica, Branek's wife, and pours him a strong, thick drink
coffee into a cup.
Everyone repeats it like a mantra. Kunicki understands what they want to tell him, he knows it himself: the island
it's too small to get lost. The island has
barely over ten kilometers long and only
two larger settlements, the towns of Vis and Komiže. You can have it
search carefully, centimeter by centimeter,
like a drawer. And people in both towns are doing well
