EN [Intro: Stormzy]
It's like
You niggas audacious
Hmm
Yeah
[Chorus: Stormzy]
I roll out with no cash on me
Calm now with no mash on me
Stay away from these ashy youts
'Fore they come around and get ash on me
That's five thousand capacity
Five thousand capacity
Then spread that over the UK
And then add it up and get back to me
You pussios are not bad for me
Mad man, they go mad for me
Who the fuck went an' gassed you up
Like you're good enough to be clashin' me?
Oh, please stop harrassin' me
Charge me up and put gas in me
Them likkle fish want to try ting
Oh, man, the audacity
[Verse 1: Stormzy]
I got girl in my inbox sendin' me eyes
Livin' on the edge 'til the end of our lives
Wolf in a sheepskin tellin' me lies
Sometimes I love when my enemy dies
Woo, so ahead of my time
Mainstream boy starts lettin' off lie
We can never, ever, ever level in price
Take that fee, and then treble it twice, yeah
The problem's back, I got flows
Watch your back, I'm on smoke
Dodge the paps and do boat
My boys are maximum boast
Ain't no time to bly man
Know my ting from here to Thailand
You man got that gun off my man
So you man got that gun on finance
Like what's this rented skeng? Buy your own
Use my pen to skeng-fry your dome
Want me to send for them, mind the throne
Cliché, rep your ends, die alone
Cliché, run your guns and die broke
I don't buy in ones, I buy bulk
Yeah, go and bust your gun, I like smoke
Rude boy, mind ya lungs, you might choke
Like cough, cough, puff, puff, pass
You're not tough or hard
They callin' me the virgin Mike
How the hell I bust so fast?
Rude boy, I came and shook my whole era
No cosigns for me and no carers
2019 and I swear I'm goin' clearer
Draw from the dead MC's like Paul Bearer
[Chorus: Stormzy & Headie One]
I roll out with no cash on me
Calm now with no mash on me
Stay away from these ashy youts
'Fore they come around and get ash on me
That's five thousand capacity
Five thousand capacity
Then spread that over the UK
And then add it up and get back to me
You pussios are not bad for me
Mad man, they go mad for me
Who the fuck went an' gassed you up
Like you're good enough to be clashin' me?
Oh, please stop harrassin' me
Charge me up and put gas in me
Them likkle fish want to try ting
Oh, man, the audacity (Turn)
[Verse 2: Headie One]
Had to slang this 'caine, no Harry
Now my track suit says Balmain Paris (One)
Smoke on bro, no Cali
So you better stay well back, Danny (One)
Oh, now we got beef in the streets
And I thought it'd only be in my patty (Turn)
'Cause I learned how to work this handy
Knowledge is power, ask Gandhi (Turn, turn, turn)
I was with the bro eatin' jollof at aunties
I told her I'm tryna be the best I can be (Turn, turn, turn)
Next day, I go end up on the opp block
Like who's on me, Chale?
Come off the wing like Andros Townsend (Turn)
I bought her a new hanny and it cost four thousand (Turn, turn)
Kept it close, paigons wanna out me (Turn, turn, turn)
They want me in a box like chicken chow mein
I wonder why opps wanna try me
Why feds put me in court and trial me?
Bad B's get bored and dial me
And ask when we're goin' to the niz, I'm like, "Shall we?"
Laid back, but still rowdy
Same goons from throwback still 'round me (One)
Funny how my old tings still shout me (One)
Oh, 'low me
Roll out, it's so casually
I'm poppin' up in cities randomly
London City or Birmingham
I just done a hundred through Canterbury (Turn)
No security, I could have a twenty in cash on me (Turn)
Trident can't believe I'm lege
So they're in the house like they're Ali G (Turn, turn, turn)
[Chorus: Stormzy]
I roll out with no cash on me
Calm now with no mash on me
Stay away from these ashy youts
'Fore they come around and get ash on me
That's five thousand capacity
Five thousand capacity
Then spread that over the UK
And then add it up and get back to me
You pussios are not bad for me
Mad man, they go mad for me
Who the fuck went an' gassed you up
Like you're good enough to be clashin' me?
Oh, please stop harrassin' me
Charge me up and put gas in me
Them likkle fish want to try ting
Oh, man, the audacity
[Outro: Stormzy]
Oh man, the audacity
Oh man, the audacity
Oh, it's a catastrophe
I changed the game drastically
Big Mike cut down Glastonbury (Big Mike)
Flashbacks from Glastonbury (Woo)
Love it when it all comes back to me (Yeah)
Telling lies, not facts on me
I roll out with no spesh on me
God's son, this is flesh on me
Stay away from these paigon youts
Cah many men, they wish death on me
When Banksy put the vest on me
Felt like God was testin' me
When Banksy put the vest on me
Felt like God was testin' me
Intro: Ghetts & Bashy]
I know, my cousin Stanaman, he's told me a couple stories about you
I'm not gonna lie-I'm not gonna lie, I'm getting mad right now, what's he talking about? Like banging in cells and that, what you talking about?
Come on, man, this is just lyrics, blud, Ghetto, this is just lyrics, blud, all about lyrics, blud, all about lyrics, I know, Ghetto, I know, come on
Easy, easy, aight, easy, easy
Talking that talk, I was a fucking bad boy in jail! A fucking bad boy, you fucking pussy
Is man mad though?
Ask Stanaman, I was a fucking bad boy
Is man mad though?
Ahh, man, man, do your research
Oi, where's Carlos, where's Carlos?
Ask him how man was in jail about
Fucking truth, stick to the truth
Stick to the fucking truth
[Verse 1: Stormzy]
Yo, yo, them man are selective bad boys
Some "we just wanna be accepted" bad boys
Some big whips but no electric bad boys
Think they're bad 'cause of Narcos, they're some Netflix bad boys
I know real shower man, you know reckless bad boys
You know them protein shake in their breakfast bad boys
Them man are some "Bro, could you get me on the guest list?" bad boys
And then they wanna get up in the club and start flexing bad boys
Give me the crown, man, I want that
Red Bull with the cognac
I tried to share my throne with 'em
But I can see you ain't on that
I'm on arms, on combat
No trace, no contact
Bro bought a new mash
I don't know what that gun there's called but it's long, akh
Bad boy who?
You are not part of a bad boy crew
Me and Flipz roll up, tell a boy, "Hold up"
Looking like something off of Bad Boys 2
Bad boy Gs in a bad boy shoot (Shoot)
You are not a bad boy, move
Shut down shows and the mandem go nuts
All the bad chicks make mad noise too
Look, fuckboy, what you gonna say? What you gonna do, run?
Ah, yeah right, you ain't gonna do none
Bad boy life ain't all that you hoped for
Should've done book but you wanna do gun
Charge three for a Z, that's banter
Black whip, all black swag like a panther
Heard through the vine that Stormz' ain't a bad boy
But I take care of my fam, I'm a gangster
Yeah, that's right, just a young boy in the hood
Fast forward, now I'm Big Mike
Still away from the hype, niggas weren't bad back then
Nah, it's cons, man, I swear on my life
Put faith in my knife, wrong move had me on edge
On the back-road, paying for my stripes
So fuck these niggas, all these likkle gun drillers
Wanna come and try do me like Trife
[Chorus: J Hus]
You're not bad, I'm bad, ask Carlos
How they gonna harm us?
Came wearing a flat-cap looking like somebody's father
I brought the bad man here, I brought the bad man here
You're a bad man how? Bad man where?
Apart from you, there's bad man here
You're not bad, I'm bad, ask Carlos
How they gonna harm us?
Came wearing a flat-cap looking like somebody's father
I brought the bad man here, I brought the bad man here
You're a bad man how? Bad man where?
Apart from you, there's bad man here
[Verse 2: Ghetts]
Yeah, I'm fully on what you're half on (Facts)
I've done dirt, no mask on (Facts)
Eighteen when I told man "Ask Carlos" (Facts)
Now they ask how much man's car cost (Facts)
Drive-by ting
Aim for your head and convertible your hard-top (Buck-I)
Your legs shake, your heart stops
That's an M case, nah, darg
Not me, not there, not G
I put bread on my beef like Soljah
You've got rice, I've got peas
I told you already, my nigga I don't know you from any–
Where, big spear that'll go through your belly
There, payback but you don't owe me a penny, yeah
Fuck that, fist fight, fair and square
Nah, fuck that, flick-knife, rer and ter
Nah, fuck that, this guy's wearing his share
Might come back, midnight, airin' a flare
Deal with the matter like Skibba
How's he gonna feel when I'm shattering his liver?
Bloodbath will fling a man up in a river
Fourteen, holding my shank in the mirror
Like I dare anyone (I dare anyone)
Playground looking like a Lunn Poly advert
Where's everyone? (Where's everyone?)
I ain't scared of you but I'm scared of your gun (I am)
Frightening
That's when I got my ting
It was all calm before Stormzy
Now it's lightning
[Chorus: J Hus]
You're not bad, I'm bad, ask Carlos
How they gonna harm us?
Came wearing a flat-cap looking like somebody's father
I brought the bad man here, I brought the bad man here
You're a bad man how? Bad man where?
Apart from you, there's bad man here
You're not bad, I'm bad, ask Carlos
How they gonna harm us?
Came wearing a flat-cap looking like somebody's father
I brought the bad man here, I brought the bad man here
You're a bad man how? Bad man where?
Apart from you, there's bad man here
Searchin' every corner of my mind
Lookin' for the answers I can't find
I have my reasons and life has its lessons and
I tried to be grateful and count all my blessings
But heavy is the head that wears the crown
Amen, in Jesus' name, yes I declare it
Any little seed I receive, I have to share it
Bruddas wanna break me down, I can't bear it
But heavy is the head with the crown, I still wear it
You can't hold me down, I still cope
Rain falling down at the BRIT's, I'm still soaked
Try to put a hole in our shit, we'll build boats
Two birds with one stone, I'll kill both (what?)
Pray I never lose and pray I never hit the shelf (two)
Promise if I do that you'll be checkin' on my health (cool)
If it's for my people I'll do anything to help
If I do it out of love it's not to benefit myself, ooh
Gotta stay around but make a comeback too
I know my only mother wants her son back too
They sayin' I'm the voice of the young black youth
And then I say "Yeah, cool" and then I bun my zoot
And now I'm
Searchin' every corner of my mind
(Search every corner, look for the answers)
Lookin' for the answers I can't find
(No, I can't find 'em, no silver lining)
I have my reasons and life has its lessons
I tried to be grateful and count all my blessings
But heavy is the head that wears the crown
Amen, in Jesus' name, oh yes I claim it
Any little bread that I make I have to break it
Bruddas wanna break me down, I can't take it
I done a scholarship for the kids, they said it's racist
That's not anti-white, it's pro-black
Hang me out to dry, I won't crack
All these fancy ties and gold plaques
Never had no silver spoons in our mouths, we sold, like
Don't comment on my culture, you ain't qualified
Stab us in the back and then apologize
If you knew my story you'd be horrified
The irony of trappin' on a Boris bike
Gotta stay alive and save my brother as well
Look at all these legends on the cover of Elle
Long time comin' but we come to prevail
I guess a little bit of heaven has to come with the hell, you know
Searchin' every corner of my mind
(Search every corner, look for the answers)
Lookin' for the answers I can't find
(No, I can't find 'em, no silver lining)
I have my reasons and life has its lessons
I tried to be grateful and count all my blessings
But heavy is the head that wears the crown
Own it
Girl, you just own it
'Cause your body's on fire
Show me how to control it
And go hit your spliff and get higher
Girl, I love how you roll it
I put my hand there, hold it
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
Lighters up, lighters up, one time, lighters up
Pulled up in the party, when you saw me, I was lightin' up my J'
So go ahead and brighten up my day
Lighters in the air when you lighting up the rave
And it's feelin' like I met you here before ('Fore)
Girl, I felt your presence when they let you through the door (Door)
Never had a bruddah give you everything and more
So I take little piece and then the rest of it is yours
Mi amore, I-
You don’t care when I don dey tell you but can you take say nah play.
Ey ey ey, I know, know wetin you dey do me,
but just dey scatter my brain (uhhh scatter)
Thug lovin' when I put you in your place
I can tell you love it, just by lookin' in your face
It's the way that you wine up your waist, I'm so in awe
Girl you never have to worry 'bout nothing
You know it's all yours
You know you
Own it
Girl, you just own it
'Cause your body's on fire
Show me how to control it
And go hit your spliff and get higher
Girl, I love how you roll it
I put my hand there, hold it
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
(Everybody, body, body, body, body have a hap, happy day)
Lights down for the one I love
Right now (Right now), we never looked better
Forget our friends, girl, I love it when we chill together
And ain't nobody gonna feel what we feel together
She want a kiss, I, I want another one
You love the sick vibe, I wanted more than one
Up to nothing, nobody knew where I was comin' from
But we got the same mind, so I don't wanna waste time
Bring it to me, come by, that's what I need
That's right, kissin' your cheek, one time
I used to love bein' alone (Alone), but now I can't stand it
Reachin' out my palm (Palm) for you to put your hand in (Ah-ahh)
Girl, you are the one and I don't understand it (Oh yeah)
How you lighten up the room with your glow (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause girl, you just-
[Refren: Burna Boy & Ed Sheeran]
Own it (Own it)
Girl, you just own it (Own it)
'Cause your body's on fire (Fire)
Show me how to control it
And go hit your spliff and get higher (Higher)
Girl, I love how you roll it (I love how you roll it)
I put my hand there (I put my hand there), hold it
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
