EN and in a foreign language, English. So
okay, don't say anything. They order fried fish
in a restaurant by the sea; it's not even
a restaurant, but the cuisine of Branek's friends. All
here they are his friends, they even look alike to each other, their features are sharper, their faces seem to be windswept, they are a tribe of sea wolves. Branko pours
wine and persuades him to drink. He drinks them himself too
in a breath. Then he won't let me pay. They are calling
him.
— They manage to get a helicopter, an airplane.
Police, says Branko.
They decide on a plan to go along the shores of the island, on Branek's boat. Kunicki calls Poland, his parents,
he hears his father's grated, homely voice, telling him that they must
stay three more days. He won't tell the truth. All
okay, they just have to stay. He also calls to
work that he has minor problems and asks for three more days
vacation. He doesn't know why he says "three days".
He's waiting for Branek at the marina. This one appears
again in his red shirt
shells, but it's a new T-shirt, clean, fresh, apparently he has many of them. They find a small cutter among the moored boats. Blue letters written on
on the side they announce the name in a rather clumsy way:
"Neptune". Then Kunicki remembers that
the ferry that brought them here was called "Poseidon". And many things, bars, shops, boats are called
"Poseidon". Or "Neptune". These two sea names
4 6
ejects like shells. I wonder how they managed it
copyright with this god. How do they pay him?
They settle in the boat, it's small and cramped, that's all
a motorboat with a wooden cabin, as if made of planks. Branko keeps water bottles there,
empty and full. In some there is wine from his vineyard,
white, good, strong. Everyone has their own vineyard here
and your wine. Branko pulls the engine out of there and mounts it on the stern. It surprises you the third time and from then on
they have to shout at each other. The noise is unbearable, but
After a while, the brain gets used to it, like to
thick winter clothing that separates the body from
the rest of the world. The view of the shrinking bay and port is slowly drowning in this noise. Kunicki sees a house,
where they lived, and even the kitchen windows and the flower
agave shooting desperately into the sky like a petrified firework, triumphant ejaculation.
Before his eyes, everything shrinks and merges: houses
— into a dark and irregular line, the port — into a chaotic white spot interspersed with lines of masts; behind
the mountains rise above the town, bare, gray, speckled with the green of vineyards. They grow and become huge.
From the inside, from the road, the island seemed small, now
its power is visible; a block of rocks arranged in a monumental cone, a fist sticking out of the water.
When they turn left, heading out of the bay into the open sea, the shore of the island seems steep and dangerous.
The sources of motion are the white crests of the crashing waves
about rocks and birds concerned about the presence of the boat. When
they turn the engine back on, the frightened birds disappear.
4 7
And again - the vertical line of a jet that splits the sky into two sheets. The plane flies south.
They're moving. Branko lights two cigarettes and one
gives it to Kunicki. It's hard to smoke, they spray from under the beak
little water droplets and they settle on everything.
- Look at the water - Branko shouts - na
everything that floats.
As they approach the bay with the cave, they see a helicopter flying in the opposite direction. Branko stands on
middle of the boat and waves. Kunicki looks at the machine,
almost happy. The island is small, he thinks for once
hundredth, nothing will be hidden from view from above
big mechanical dragonfly, everything will be visible
like on a plate.
- Let's sail to the "Poseidon" - he shouts to Branek,
but he is not convinced.
“There's no passage there,” he shouts back.
However, the cutter turns and slows down. Influence between
rocks with the engine off.
This part of the island should be called "Poseidon" too
like everything, Kunicki thinks. God built himself here
own cathedrals: naves, caves, columns and choirs. Lines
are unpredictable, the rhythm is false and uneven. The black igneous rocks glisten with water as if covered
it is a rare dark metal. Now, at dusk,
these buildings are devastatingly sad, it's the essence
abandonment, no one ever prayed here. Kunicki
he suddenly has the impression that he is seeing human prototypes
churches that all activities should be conducted here
trips before going to Reims, to Chartres.

He wants to share this discovery with Branek, but the noise is too great to speak. They see another, bigger one
a boat with the inscription: "Police. Split". Flows along the steep
shore line. The boats approach each other and Branko talks to the policemen. There are no traces, nothing.
At least that's what Kunicki thinks, because of the roar of the engine
drowns out the conversation. I think they communicate with movement
lips and a gentle, helpless lifting of the arms that
it doesn't match their white police shirts with epaulettes. They tell us to go back because it will soon get dark.
That's all Kunicki hears: "Come back." Branko adds
gas, it sounds like an explosion. The water goes numb, into the sea
waves spread, tiny like shivers.
Landing on an island looks completely different than
during the day. First they see sparkling saints
atlas which
with each moment they become more and more separated from each other
and form ranks. They grow in the gathering darkness, they stand still
separate, different - the lights of the yachts arriving at the quay are different, and the lights in the windows of the houses are different; there are others
illuminated signs, and other moving car lights. A safe view of a tamed world.
Finally, Branko turns off the engine and the boat docks
to the shore. Suddenly, the underside is scraping across the rocks - they have arrived at a small town beach just below
hotel, far from the marina. Now Kunicki guesses
wonder why. At the ramp, right on the beach, there is a police car and two men in white shirts
clearly waiting for them.
“I think they want to talk to you,” Branko says
and the boat moors. Kunicki suddenly weakens, he is afraid of what
4 9
can hear. That they found the bodies. That's what he's afraid of. Going to
them on soft legs.
Thank God, it's just a simple interrogation.
No, they don't have anything new. But so much time has passed
the matter became serious. They take him along the same road, the only one on the island, to Vis, to the police station. It's already
quite dark, but they obviously know the way well,
because they don't even slow down on corners. They pass quickly
that place.
There are new guys waiting for him at the station. Translator,
a tall, handsome man who speaks, let's be honest, poor Polish - they brought him specially from Split - and an officer. They ask routine questions
questions, somehow indifferently, and it dawns on him that he was standing
become suspicious.
They take him right to the hotel. He gets out and makes a move,
as if he were about to go in there. However, he only pretends to enter. He waits in the dark corridor until they leave, until
the roar of the car engine fades away, and he goes outside
street. He walks towards the largest cluster of lights,
towards the boulevard by the marina, where they are all
cafes and restaurants. But it's late and even though
it's Friday, there's no more crowd; it must be one or two in the morning. Among the few customers at the tables
he looks for Branek, but he doesn't see him there,
I can't find a T-shirt with a shell. There are some Italians, all of them
family, they finish eating, he also sees two elderly people,
they sip something through a straw and watch the noisy one
Italian family. About two fair-haired women,
facing each other familiarly, touching each other's shoulders,
50
busy talking. Local men, fishermen, something
couple. What a relief that no one pays attention to him...
He walks along the edge of the shadow, right next to the waterfront, smelling the scent
fish and a warm, salty breeze from the sea. It has
I feel like turning up into one of the streets running through it
towards Branek's house, but he doesn't dare, they're probably sleeping.
So he sits down at a small table at the edge of the garden. The waiter ignores him.
He watches the men coming together
next table. They sit down and add one chair, there it is
five of them. Before the waiter comes, before they even order drinks, they are already bound by an invisible bond.
They are of different ages, two of them have thick beards,
but soon all these differences will disappear in the circle that
they have already involuntarily formed. They say, but it's not important
what they say - it might look like they're getting ready
to sing together, test their voices. Laughter fills the space inside the circle - jokes, even
the well-known ones are absolutely appropriate, even
desired. This laugh is low, vibrating, lifting
space and tells tourists to remain silent next to the neighboring one
table - suddenly frightened middle-aged women
century. It attracts interesting glances.
They are preparing an audience. The waiter enters with a tray
drinks becomes an overture, and the waiter, a young boy,
he becomes an unsuspecting emcee who
announces dance, opera. They come alive at the sight of him,
a hand comes up and shows him a place - here.
A moment of silence, and the glass edges go to your mouth.
Some of them, the most impatient ones,

V
you can't avoid closing your eyes, just like
in church, when the priest reverently lays it down
white wafer with outstretched tongue. The world is ready to tip over - only conventionally the floor is under
legs, and the ceiling above the head, the body no longer belongs only
to itself, but it is part of a living chain, a piece of a living circle. Yes, and now the glasses go to
the mouth, the very moment of emptying it is almost invisible, it is done with immediate concentration,
with momentary seriousness. From now on men will follow theirs
hold - glasses. Bodies sitting around the table
they will begin to make circles, the tops of their heads will trace circles in the air, first smaller ones, then later
bigger. They will overlap, drawing new arcs.
Eventually hands will arise, they will try their own first
strength in the air, in the gestures that illustrate words, and then they go to the arms of companions, to
their shoulders and backs, patting them and supporting them. They will be these
actually loving touches. The fraternization of arms and backs is not intrusive, it is a dance.
Kunicki looks at it with envy. He would like to go out
from the shadows and join them. He doesn't know this intensity. It is closer to the north, where there is a community of men
she is more shy. But in the south, where
sun and wine opens bodies faster and more shamelessly, this one
the dance becomes completely real. After an hour, the first body falls
and stops it on the back of the chair.
Kunicki's back is hit by the warm paw of the night breeze, pushing him towards the tables, as if urging him:
"Come, come." He would like to join them, do52
wherever they go. He wished they would take him away
together.
He returns on the unlit side of the boulevard to the hotel,
making sure not to cross the line of darkness. Before
enters the narrow and stuffy staircase, it takes off
air and stands still for a moment. Then the trunks
up the stairs, feeling for the steps in the dark,
and immediately falls on the bed fully clothed, on his stomach, with his arms spread to the sides as if someone had shot him
in the back, and he contemplated the bullet for a moment,
and then he died.
He gets up after a few hours, two, three, because
it's still dark, and he feels his way down to the car. The alarm sounds, the car blinks knowingly, longing. Kunicki unpacks the luggage from it,
all, how's it going. He carries suitcases up the stairs and throws them on the floor in the kitchen and living room. Two suitcases
and lots of bundles, bags, baskets, including this one
with provisions for the journey, a set of fins in a plastic bag, masks, an umbrella, beach mats and a box with wines and ajvar purchased on the island,
with that paprika puree that they liked so much,
and also jars of olives. He turns on all the lights and sits
now in this mess. He then takes her purse and gently shakes the contents onto the kitchen table. He sits down
and looks at the pile of pathetic objects,
as if it were a complicated game of sticks and him
it was necessary to move - to draw one piece so that no
move others. After a moment of hesitation, he takes it in his hand
lipstick and unscrews the cap. Dark red, great 53
knows new. She didn't use it often. He smells it. It smells
nice, it's hard to say what. He gains courage and that's it
he takes each item in turn and places them separately on the
table. Passport - old, with blue covers, on
in the photo she is much younger, she has long hair, loose, with bangs. Signature on the last page
is blurry, which is why they often keep her at the border. Black notebook, closed with an elastic band. He opens it
and flips through the pages - some notes, a drawing of a jacket,
column of numbers, business card of the bistro in Polanica, at the back
a telephone number, a lock of hair, dark hair, even
not bundles, just several dozen individual ones
hair. He puts it aside. Then he will look more closely.
A cosmetic bag made of exotic Indian material,
inside: dark green pencil, powder compact (almost
there is no powder in it), green mascara in a spiral,
plastic sharpener, lip gloss, tweezers,
a blackened broken chain. He still finds a ticket
to the museum in Trogir, on the back there is an inscription, a foreign word; he brings the cardboard to his eyes and reads with difficulty: Koupóc,
probably K-A-I-R-O-S, but he's not sure, it doesn't matter to him
says. There's a lot of sand at the bottom.
Cell phone, almost dead. Checks the last one
calls - his own number is displayed, mostly, but there are others, they don't tell him anything, or two or
Three. "Received messages" - only one - from
him when they got lost in Trogir. "I'm at the fountain in the main square." "Sent messages"
- empty. Returns to the main menu on the screen
a pattern lights up for a moment, then goes off.

A package of opened tissues.
Pencil, two pens, one yellow note, the other with the inscription "Hotel Mercure". Small coins, grosze and eurocents. A purse with Croatian banknotes, a few, and Polish ten zlotys. Visa card.
A block of orange pieces of paper, dirty.
A copper pin with some antique pattern,
looks broken. Two kopiko candies. Digital camera in a black case. Nail.
White paperclip. Sweetie after chewing gum. Crumbs.
Sand.
He arranges it all carefully on the matte black countertop, each item at an equal distance from
second. He goes to the tap and drinks water. It goes back to
table and lights a cigarette. Then he starts taking photos
her camera, to each object separately. He takes photos slowly, with solemnity, at maximum speed
close-up, with flash on. My only regret is
that this little camera can't take a picture of itself
alone. He is also evidence in the case. later
he moves to the hall, where there are bags and suitcases, and one picture clicks for each of them. But not on this one
he stops, unpacks his suitcases and starts taking photos of every piece of clothing, every pair of shoes, every single one
a tube of cream and a book. Little one's toys. Throws away
he even takes a photo of dirty clothes from a plastic bag and takes a photo of this shapeless pile.
He finds a small bottle of rakija and drinks it in one
at a glance, with the camera in his hands, he finally takes a photo of the empty bottle.

It's already light when he sets off in his car
Visu. He has with him dried sandwiches that she made for the road. In the heat, the butter flowed, soaked the pieces of bread with a shiny fatty layer, the yellow cheese now
it is hard and semi-transparent like plastic. Eats
two, leaving Komiža; he wipes his hands on his pants.
He drives slowly, carefully, looking to the sides, at everything he passes, remembering that there is alcohol in his blood.
But it feels strong and reliable like a machine. NO
he looks back, though
that he knows that the sea is growing meter by meter behind him. The air is like this
so clean that you can probably see the shores from the top
Italian. For now, he stops in bays and examines everything around him, every piece of paper, every piece of trash.
He also has Branek's binoculars - he looks at the slopes through them.
He sees rocky slopes covered with burnt mulch,
gray grass, sees bushes of immortal blackberries, darkened by the sun, clinging
with long shoots of stones. Poor, feral olives
with twisted trunks, remaining stone walls
through abandoned vineyards.
After about an hour, slowly, like a patrol
police, starts driving towards Vis. They pass a small supermarket where they shopped, mostly for wine, and that's it
he's in town at the moment.
The ferry has already docked at the quay. It's huge, as big as a building, a floating block. "Poseidon".
The great gates had already been opened, and a queue of cars and sleepy people had formed into this gaping cave; In a second
they will start letting in. Kunicki stands at the barrier and looks at the group of ticket buyers. Some are with backpacks, among them a beautiful girl in a colorful one
turban; he looks at her, he can't look away.
Next to the girl is a tall, Scandinavian boy
beauty. There are women with children, probably local women, without them
luggage, a man in a suit with a briefcase. Is
couple - she is pressed against his chest, his eyes are closed
eyes, as if she wanted to sleep too little for a night. And a few
cars - one loaded to the roof, with German registration plates, two Italian ones. And local luggage - for bread, vegetables, mail. The island must
lives. Kunicki discreetly looks into the cars.
Finally, the cable car starts moving, the ferry swallows people and cars, no one protests, they move like calves. Another group of French motorcyclists arrives, five of them, they are the last ones and they obediently disappear into the mouth
"Poseidon".
Kunicki waits until the gate closes with a mechanical creak. The ticket collector closes the window and goes out to smoke a cigarette. They both witness how
the ferry leaves the shore with a sudden noise.
He says he is looking for a woman and a child, takes her passport out of his pocket and puts it under the man's nose.
The ticket agent looks at the photo in the passport and leans forward
above him. He says something like this in Croatian:
— The police have already asked us about her. No one has seen her here - he takes a drag on his cigarette and adds: - No
there is a big island, you would remember it.
Suddenly he puts his hand on Kunicki's shoulder, as if they had known each other for a long time.
5 6
- Coffee? Do you want some coffee? — and shows with his head
a cafe just opening at the port.
Yes, coffee. Why not?
Kunicki sits down at a small table and the other one sits behind it
moment comes with double espressos. They drink in silence.
“Don't worry,” says the usher. - Not here
it's like getting lost. We are all visible here
at your fingertips. — That's what he says and shows his open hand
plowed through with several thick lines. Then he brings it
him a roll with cutlet and lettuce. He finally leaves
leaving Kunicki over the half-finished coffee. When
disappears, Kunicki lets out a short sob; is like
bite of the roll, so he swallows it without feeling the taste.
He can't get rid of the phrase that they are visible as
on the hand. By whom? Who would have it all on them
look at this island in the sea, at the asphalt threads
roads from port to port, several thousand people, locals and tourists, melting in the heat
moving. Images from satellite photos flash in his head, apparently he can see an inscription on them
matchbox. Is it possible? Sure and it's visible
from there his beginnings of baldness. Big cool sky
full of moving eyes of restless satellites.
He returns to the car through the small cemetery near the church. All graves face towards
the sea, as in an amphitheater, so the dead observe the slow, repetitive rhythm of the port. It probably makes them happy
white ferry, maybe they even take it for an archangel who
escorts souls on this heavenly journey.
5 8
Kunicki notices that several names are repeated.
People here must be like those cats - they hide
inbred, they live within the circle of several families, and rarely go beyond them. He stops only once - he sees
a small tombstone and just two rows of letters:
Zorka 9 Feb 21-1 7 Feb 54
Srečan 29 January 54 - 17 July 54
He searches for algebra in these dates for a while
okay, they look like a cipher. Mother and son. Some
a tragedy presented in dates, divided into stages. Relay.
And that's the end of the city. He is tired, the heat has reached
zenith and now sweat is pouring from his eyes. As he climbs again
takes a car deep into the island, he sees that the bright sun turns it into the most unfriendly place on the planet
earth. The heat is ticking like a time bomb.
At the police station, they offer him a cold beer, as if
they wanted to hide their helplessness under white foam. "Nobody
he hasn't seen them," says the bulky official, politely
turns the fan towards him.
- What to do? - he asks the policeman, standing in the doorway.
“Just rest,” the other replies.
But Kunicki stays at the police station and listens to all telephone conversations, all of them
hidden meanings walkie-talkie crackles until it comes
Branko picks him up and takes him to dinner. Almost no
they are talking. Then he tells me to take him back to the hotel, yes
and lies on the bed fully clothed. I feel mine
sweat; the disgusting smell of fear.
He lies in his clothes among the things thrown out of bags,
on the back. His eyes carefully examine their constellation,
mutual location, indicated directions, created figures. It could be a prophecy. There is a letter there for him, written about his wife and child, but
primarily regarding himself. Does not know
she certainly did not write this letter or these signs
their human hand. Their connection with him is obvious,
the very fact that he looks at them is important; and the fact that he sees them is the great mystery, the fact that he can see them at all
look and see, the secret is that it exists.
Everywhere and nowhere
When I go on a journey, I disappear from the maps. No one no
knows where I am. At the point where I left,
or at the point I'm aiming for? Is there any
"in between"? Am I like that lost day when
one flies to the east, and the night is found when heading west?
Do I apply the same law that quantum physics is proud of - that a particle can exist
simultaneously in two places? Or another one that we don't know about yet and hasn't been proven
— that it is possible to not exist twice in one and the other
same place?
I think there are many like me. disappeared,
absent. They suddenly appear in terminals at 60
flights and begin to exist when officials tell them to do so
passport stamp or when the polite receptionist
in some hotel he will give them the key. They probably discovered it
already its instability and dependence on places, times of day,
depending on the language or the city and its climate. Fluidity, mobility, illusoryness - this is what it means to be civilized. Barbarians don't travel, they just
they go to the goal or make raids.
The woman who offers me herbal tea from a thermos while we are both waiting for the bus thinks similarly
from the station to the airport; her hands are painted with henna
into a complex pattern that becomes more intense day by day
becomes illegible. When we get in, he gives me a lecture on
topic of time. He says that settled, agricultural people prefer
the pleasures of circular time, in which each event must return to its own beginning, fold back
into an embryo and repeat the process of maturation and death.
But nomads and merchants, when setting out on their journey, had to find another time for themselves that would better suit the journey. It's linear time, more useful,
because it is a measure of the pursuit of the goal and the accumulation of percentages. Each moment is different and will never be repeated, so it encourages taking risks and taking full advantage,
seizing the moment. But that was basically it
a bitter discovery - when change in time is irreversible, loss and mourning become commonplace.
That's why words like this never come out of their mouths
"futile" and "exhausted".
“A wasted effort, exhausted accounts,” he laughs
this woman appears and puts her painted hands behind her head.
