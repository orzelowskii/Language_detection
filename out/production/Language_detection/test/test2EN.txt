Well, he is now writing to me from Lyon that Ludwik Stawski is alive and lives in Algiers, only under the name of Ernest Walter. Apparently he trades wine. A year ago someone did it
he saw.
“We'll check it,” Wokulski replied and calmly noted the address in the catalogue.
From then on, he spent every afternoon with the Łęcki family, and even stayed there once and for all
invited to dinner.
Within a few days, Rzecki came to him.
— Well, my old man! - Wokulski exclaimed. - How is Prince Lulu?... You're angry
Are you still angry at Szlangbaum for having the courage to buy the store?…
The old salesman shook his head.
- Mrs. Stawska - he said - she's not at Milerowe's anymore... she's a little sick... She says something
about leaving Warsaw... Maybe you could stop by?...
“True, you'd have to go,” he replied, rubbing his forehead. — Have you talked to her about the store?
- Yes; I borrowed as much as one thousand two hundred rubles.
- From your poor savings? Why can't you borrow from me?...
Rzecki didn't answer anything.
Before two, Wokulski went to Mrs. Stawskie. She was very miserable; గeగ sweet
the eyes seemed even bigger and even sadder.
- What is it - asked Wokulski - I heard that you want to leave Warsaw?
"Yes, sir... Maybe your husband will return..." she added in a muffled voice.
- Rzecki told me about it and let me try to check this news...
Mrs. Stawska burst into tears.
“You are so good to us,” she whispered. - May you be happy...
At the same time, Mrs. Wąsowska was visiting Miss Izabela and found out
from them that Wokulski was admitted.
“Finally…” said Mrs. Wąsowska. — I thought you would never make up your mind.
- So I made you a pleasant surprise - replied Miss Izabela. —
In any case, he is the perfect husband: rich, extraordinary, and above all, a human being
dove heart. Not only is he not jealous, but he even apologizes for his suspicions. This is me
finally disarmed... True love is blindfolded. You don't answer me anything?
- I think…
- About what?
— That if he knows you as much as you know him, then you both don't know each other very well.
- This will make it more pleasant for us to have a honeymoon.
- I wish…

From mid-April, Baroness Krzeszowska suddenly changed her lifestyle.
So far, the day has been spent thinking about things for Marianna, writing letters to
tenants about the stairs being littered, asking the guard whether someone had torn the card
apartment rental? whether laundresses from Parisian laundries stay at home at night or whether the police officer
he had no interest in it? At the same time, she did not forget to warn him so that in case of emergency
he was closely watching the competitor's application for a premises on the third floor, especially...
young people, and if they were students, he would answer that the premises were already rented.
“Careful, Kacper, what I tell you,” she concluded, “because you will lose your place if I tell you here.”
A student will sneak in. I'm fed up with these nihilists, debauchers, atheists who...
they bear dead heads.
After each such conference, the guard returned to his cell and threw his hat on the table.
and shouted:
- Either I'm sorry, I'll hang myself, or I won't be able to stand with such a lady any longer! On Friday
to the market - go, watchman, to the pharmacy twice a day in summer, to the mangle and sickness
knows where not to go. After all, she already told me that I would go with her to the cemetery
to tidy up the grave!... Are these things heard in the world?... I will go away from here to Saint John,
that I should give someone twenty rubles as compensation...
But since mid-April, the baroness has softened.

Several circumstances contributed to this.
First of all, one day an unknown lawyer visited her with a confidential question - Husband, Money, Wife
I don't know if the Baroness knows anything about Mr. Baron's funds... If so
where they existed, which the lawyer doubts, it would be necessary to point them out in order to free you
baron from embarrassment. His creditors are ready to seize the ultimate debts
resources.
The baroness solemnly assured the lawyer that her husband, the baron, despite all the perversity and torment he had caused, did not have any funds. Including
She suffered spasms there, which prompted the lawyer to quickly retreat. And when the priest
justice left the apartment, she recovered very quickly and called out
Marianny said to them in an extremely calm voice:
— Perhaps, Marysia, we should put on fresh curtains, because I have a feeling that our unhappy master will convert...
A few days later, the prince visited the baroness in his own person. They closed down
camp in the farthest room and they had a long conference, during which the lady started crying several times and fainted once. What they would talk about, however, he doesn't know
even Marianna. Only after the prince left, the baroness ordered Mr. Maruszewicz to be called immediately, and when he came running, she said in a strangely gentle voice, interspersing her speech with
sighs:
— It seems to me, Mr. Maruszewicz, that my errant husband will finally come to his senses...
So be kind enough to go to town and buy a man's bathrobe and a pair of slippers. Take it to your measure,
because both of you, poor people, are equally slim...
Mr. Maruszewicz raised his eyebrows, but took the money and ran the errand. Baroness's price: four
100 rubles for a bathrobe and six for slippers seemed a bit high, but
Mr. Maruszewicz replied that he did not know the price, that he bought from first-class stores
magazines, and no one talked about it anymore.
After a few days, two Jews came to Mrs. Krzeszowskie's apartment
asking if Mr. Baron was at home... The Baroness, instead of screaming at them as she usually did, told them to go out the door in a very calm tone. later
calling Caspar, she said to him:
— "It seems to me, dear Kacper, that our poor master will come to us today
or గtomorrow. You have to put the cloth on the stairs from the second floor... Just be careful, maybe
a child, so that they don't steal the rods... And the cloth has to be beaten every few days...
From that moment on, she didn't think anything of Marianne, she didn't write letters, she didn't torment the guard...
Only for whole days, with her arms folded on her chest, she walked around her vast garden
apartment, pale, silent, irritated.
When she heard the clatter of a carriage stopping in front of the house, she ran to the window; At the sound of the bell, she rushed to the threshold and listened from behind the closed door of the living room to hear who was talking
with Marianna.
After a few days of this lifestyle, she became even paler and even more irritated. She ran faster and faster into smaller and smaller spaces, often falling on a chair
or an armchair, with a heartbeat, and finally she went to bed.
“Tell me to take the cloth off the stairs,” she said to Marianna in a hoarse voice. —
Some scoundrel must have lent you money again...
As soon as she said this, there was an energetic knock on the door. The baroness sent
Marianne first, and, touched by a premonition, despite the headache, she began to dress.
Everything was flying out of my hands.
Meanwhile, Marianna, having opened the chained door, saw the Servant in the hall
Some very distinguished gentleman with a silk umbrella and a hand-held suitcase. Behind
"a guy who, despite his neatly shaved mustache and big favorites, looked
somewhat like a butler, there were porters with tanks and pistons.
“And what is it?” asked the maid mechanically.
“Open the door, both halves!” replied the gentleman with the suitcase. -Your things
baron and maybe…
The door opened, His Majesty ordered the porters to put their trunks and pistons in the hall.
and asked:
- Where is your lordship's office?...
ఝ  Doll 
At that moment, the baroness came running with her robe unbuttoned and her hair in disarray.
“What is it?” she exclaimed in a moved voice. - Oh, it's you, Leon... Where are you?...
— It seems that you are at Stępek's... I would like to put my things together, but I don't see any
master's office, no room for me.
“Wait until…” the baroness said feverishly. - Marianna will leave soon
from the kitchen, that's you there...
- Me in the kitchen?... - asked the gentleman called Leon. - You must be joking. According to the agreement with you, I am supposed to have my own room...
The Baroness was confused.
“What am I saying!” she said. - You know that, Leon, in the meantime, move in
third floor, for students' apartments...
“That's how I understand it,” Leon replied. — If there are a few rooms there, I can
even live with the cook…
- How about the cook?
- Because you and I cannot do without a cook. Take these things on
up, he said to the porters.
- What are you doing?... - shouted the baroness, seeing that they were taking all the mugs.
and pistons.
— Maybe they're taking things. Carry! - Leon commanded.
- And where is Mr. Baron?...
- Oh, please... - replied the servant, giving Marianna a hand-held suitcase and an umbrella.
- And the bedding?... wardrobe?... utensils?... - exclaimed the lady, wringing her hands.
- Madam, don't make a scandal at the service!... - Leon rebuked her. —
You should have all these things at home...
“True... true!” whispered the humiliated baroness.
Having installed himself upstairs, where he still had to be carried a bed, a table, a couple of chairs and a basin with a jug of water, Mr. Leon dressed in a jacket, a white tie and a fresh shirt.
(a little tight for him), he returned to the Baroness and sat down seriously in the hall.
"In half an hour," he said to Marianna, looking at his gold watch, "Mr.
he should be, because he sleeps from four o'clock to five o'clock every day. - Well, is it boring here, miss?
- added. - Well, but I'll get the lady going...
- Marianna!... Marianna, come here!... - the baroness called from her room.
- Why are you leaving soon? - Leon asked. - Will the old business disappear or what?...
Let him wait a while...
“When I'm scared because I'm terribly angry,” Marianna whispered, tearing away from his hands.
- Bad, because you yourself spoiled it. If you just let them, they'll be the pins of a man
on your head... You'll have an easier time with the baron, because he's a connoisseur... But dress
Miss, you have to do it differently, not in the traditional way. We don't like nuns.
- Marysia!... Marysia!...
- Well, go ahead, miss, but slowly, Leon admonished.
Contrary to Leon's predictions, the baron arrived at his wife's house not at four o'clock, but...
only around five.
He was wearing a new coat and a fresh hat, and was holding a silver cane in his hand
horse leg. He had a calm face, but under these appearances the faithful servant saw strength

him incomparably more than beforea duel or even at the stake."Please, Baroness," said Mr. Krzeszowski, somewhat subdued
