EN in the "Nowa" cafe, at one of the two tables
exposed outdoors. He was reading the local newspaper
in which the most interesting crime section was always the one with reports about the robbery of jam cellars
and gherkins.
Their touristic holiday trips, scary,
a Skoda packed to the ceiling. Prepared for a long time, planned in the evenings in early spring, when the snow had barely gone but the earth had not yet sobered up;
you had to wait until she finally gave her body to the plows and hoes, until she was fertilized and then
it will take them time from morning to evening.
They were part of the generation that drove around with caravans, dragging a substitute behind them
home. Gas stove, foldable tables and chairs.
Plastic rope for hanging laundry at rest stops
and wooden clips. Oilcloths for the table, waterproof. Tourist picnic set - colorful
plastic plates, cutlery, salt shakers and glasses.
My father bought it somewhere on the road, at some flea market
fairs, which he and his mother especially liked to visit
(when they weren't taking photos in front of churches and monuments), a military kettle - a copper instrument, a vessel with a tube inside into which
a handful of sticks and it was lit. And even at campsites
you could use electricity, you could boil water
in this teapot, smoking and making a mess. He was kneeling over
hot pot and proudly listened to the gurgling sound
boiling water, which he poured over tea bags - a real nomad.

They sat down in marked places, on camping sites, always in the company of others
just like them, chatting with their neighbors
over socks drying on tent lines.
Guided travel routes were carefully planned
marking attractions. In the afternoon a swim in the sea or in a lake, and in the afternoon a trip to the ancient monuments of the city ending with dinner - usually
these were vegetables: goulash, minced cutlets, meatballs in sauce
tomato. All we had to do was cook pasta or rice. Saving money forever, golden
is weak, it's a penny in the world. Searching for places where
you can plug in, and then reluctantly pack up to move on, but always in the metaphysical orbit of home. They were not true travelers because they left to come back. And they were coming back
with relief, with a sense of duty well done.
They returned to collect piles of letters and bills from the dresser. Do a big load of laundry. Yawning furtively
bore your friends to death by showing them your photos. This
we in Carcassonne. And here is the wife, the Acropolis in the background.
Then they lived a sedentary life for a whole year, that strange life when in the morning you come back to what you left behind
in the evening, where your clothes are saturated with the smell of your own apartment and your feet are tirelessly trampling
path on the carpet.
It's not for me. Apparently I was missing some
a gene that makes it so that as soon as you agree to...
longer in a place, you soon take root.
I have tried many times, but my roots always remain
11
they were shallow and any gust of wind would blow me over. I couldn't sprout, I was deprived
this plant ability. I don't draw sap from the earth, I am anti-Antheus. My energy comes from movement - from the shaking of buses, from the roar of planes,
from the rocking of ferries and trains.
I am handy, small and well packed.
I have a small stomach, undemanding, strong lungs,
tight stomach and strong arm muscles. I don't take any medications, I don't wear glasses, I don't use hormones. I cut my hair with a clipper once every three months, and I almost don't use any cosmetics. I'm healthy
teeth, maybe not even, but intact, only one old one
a filling, probably in the lower left corner. I have a liver
normal. Pancreas - normal. The right and left kidneys are in excellent condition. My abdominal aorta is
normal. Urinary bladder - normal. Hemoglobin - 12.7. Leukocytes - 4.5. Hematocrit
— 41.6. Platelets - 228. Cholesterol - 204.
Creatinine - 1.0. Bilirubin 4.2 and so on. My
IQ - if you believe it - 121; enough. I have
particularly developed spatial imagination, almost eidetic, but poor lateralization. Profile
unstable personalities, probably untrustworthy. Age
— psychological. Gender - grammatical. I tend to buy books in soft covers so that I can read them without regrets
leave them on the platform for other eyes. Nothing
I collect.
I finished my studies, but I didn't actually learn any profession, which I regret very much;
12
my great-grandfather was a weaver, he whitened woven cloth,
spreading them out on the slope, exposing them to the scorching rays of the sun. I would really like the warp and weft interlacing, but there are no alternatives
looms and weaving are the art of settled peoples. I knit when I travel. Unfortunately some recently
airlines prohibit taking wires on board
and crochet. I learned nothing, as I say
profession, and yet contrary to what they always repeated
my parents, I managed to survive, taking on various jobs along the way and not hitting rock bottom.
When my parents returned to the city after a twenty-year romantic experiment, they got tired
their droughts and frosts, healthy food that
and all winters
she was sick in the basement, wool from her own sheep carefully stuffed into the cavernous throats of the blankets and quilts,
I got some money from them for the first time
I hit the road.
I worked part-time wherever I went. In an international factory on the outskirts of a large metropolis, I assembled antennas for exclusive ones
yachts. There were many like me there. They were hiring
us in black, without asking about our origins and plans for
future. We got paid on Friday, and who?
he didn't respond, he didn't show up on Monday.
Future students were here during the break between their final exams
and university entrance exams. Immigrants still on the way
to an ideal, just country somewhere in the West, where people are sisters and brothers, and a strong state plays the role of a caring parent; fugitives
13
running away from families - wives, husbands, parents; unhappily in love, distracted, melancholic and always cold. Those who were hunted
law because they were unable to repay their loans. Tramps, vagabonds. Crazy people after...
next recurrence of the disease, they were taken to hospital,
from where - under unclear regulations - they were deported to their country of origin.
Only one Indian worked here permanently, for years,
but truth be told, his situation was no different at all
away from ours. He had no insurance whatsoever
vacation. He worked in silence, patiently, at a steady pace. He was never late, never
found reasons for dismissal. I persuaded several people to form a trade union - these were them
the times of Solidarity - even if only for him, but no
he wanted. Moved by my interest, he treated me to spicy curry that he brought every day
in canteens. Today I don't even remember what it was like
name.
I was a waitress, a maid in an upscale restaurant
hotel and nanny. I sold books, I sold tickets. In a certain small theater for one
I got a job as a dresser this season and that's how I survived the long winter among the plush backdrops,
heavy costumes, satin capes and wigs. When
I finished my studies, I also worked as a teacher,
addiction consultant and, recently, in the library. As soon as I managed to earn some money, I hit the road.

Head in the world
I studied psychology in a large, gloomy communist city, my department was located in a building that was the headquarters of an SS unit during the war.
This part of the city was built on the ruins of the ghetto, easy
you could see it if you looked closely
— the entire district stood about a meter higher than the rest
cities. One meter of rubble. I never felt comfortable there; between new blocks of flats and miserable squares
the wind was always blowing and the air seemed frosty
particularly severe, it stung my face. In fact, despite the development, it was still a place
belonging to the dead. I have a dream about the institute building
to this day - its wide corridors, as if carved in stone, slicked by someone's feet, worn
stair edges, hand-polished handrails,
traces left in space. Maybe that's why we were haunted by ghosts.
When we let the rats into the maze, he was always there
one whose behavior contradicted the theory and who
he didn't care about our clever hypotheses. He stood on two
paws, not at all interested in the reward at the end
experimental route; reluctant to enjoy the privileges of the Pavlovian reflex, he looked around us and then turned back or leisurely explored the maze. He was looking for something in the side corridors, he tried
to attract attention. He squeaked in confusion,
and then the girls, against the rules, took him out
from the maze and took them in their arms.
15
The dead, sprawled frog's muscles were flexing
and rectified under the dictation of electrical impulses,
but in a way that has not yet been described
in our textbooks - they gave us signs
and the limbs made obvious gestures of threat and mockery, which contradicted the time-honored belief in the mechanical innocence of physiological reflexes.
We were taught here that the world can be described, even
explain with simple answers to intelligent questions. That in its essence it is inert
and dead that it is governed by quite simple laws that
should be explained and given - preferably using
diagram. We were demanded to experiment. Formulating hypotheses. Verifying. It was being introduced
us into the secrets of statistics, believing that it can be used to perfectly describe all regularities
world - that 90 percent is more significant than
five.
But today I know one thing: he who seeks order,
let him avoid psychology. Let him decide instead
for physiology or theology, he will have at least
solid support - either in matter or in spirit; NO
it slips on the psyche. The psyche is a very uncertain subject of research.
Those who said this direction were right
one chooses not because of future work, curiosity or a calling to help others, but because of something else
a very simple reason. I suspect everyone is
we had some deeply hidden defect, although we probably gave the impression of being intelligent and healthy

young people - the defect was masked efficiently

tested in entrance exams. Ball
emotions, tightly tangled, felted like those strange tumors that are sometimes found in the human body and which
can be seen in any self-respecting museum
anatomopathology. But maybe our examiners too
they were people of the same kind and in fact
did they know what they were doing? We would therefore be their heirs.
When in the second year we discussed functioning
defense mechanisms and discovered with awe the power of this part of our psyche - we began to understand that if rationalizations did not exist,
sublimation, repression, all the tricks that
we regale ourselves that if it were possible to look at the world without any protection, honestly and courageously
— our hearts would break.
We found out during these studies that we are
built of defenses, shields and armor, we are cities whose architecture is reduced to walls,
towers and fortifications; bunker countries.
We conducted all tests, interviews and examinations on each other and after the third year of studies I was able to name what was wrong with me; It was
like discovering your own secret name, which is
initiation is called for.
I didn't stay long in my profession.
During one of my trips, when I was stuck without
money in the big city and worked as a maid, I started writing a book. It was a story to
17
journey, to read on the train, as if I was writing it for myself. The book is a tartin, to be swallowed
right away, without biting.
I was able to focus and concentrate properly, and for some time I became a monster of an ear
to listen to murmurs, echoes and rustles; distant voices coming from behind some wall.
But I never became a real writer or
— better to say — a writer, because of that kind
this word sounds more serious. Life has always eluded me. I only found traces of him, some faint ones
molting. When I tracked its position, it was already there
elsewhere. I only found signs, like these inscriptions
on the bark of park trees: "I was here." In mine
writing, life turned into incomplete stories,
dreamlike stories, obscure plots, were published
from a distance in unusual shifting perspectives or cross-sections - and it's difficult
It would be nice to draw some conclusions about the whole thing.
Anyone who has ever tried to write a novel knows what a difficult task it is, this is undoubtedly one
one of the worst ways of self-employment. It's necessary to
stay inside yourself all the time, in a single-person cell,
in complete solitude. It's a controlled psychosis
paranoia with obsession harnessed to work, therefore deprived of feathers, robes and Venetian masks, from which
we know them, but rather dressed up in butcher's aprons
and rubber boots, with a gutting knife in his hand. See you
only the feet of passersby leave this writer's basement,
the click of heels is heard. Sometimes someone will agree that18
to bend down and take a look inside, you can see a human face and even exchange a few words.
In fact, the mind is occupied with its own game
rolls before himself in a hastily sketched manner
panopticon, placing the figures on a makeshift table
stage - author and hero, narrator and reader,
the one who describes and the one described; feet, shoes, heels
and faces will become part of this game sooner or later.
I don't regret taking a liking to this particular one
job - I wouldn't be a good fit to be a psychologist. NO
I knew how to explain, to bring people out of the darkroom of minds
family photos. Confidences of others - these often
They bored me, which I admit with sadness. Speaking
Honestly, there were often times when I wished we could reverse ours
relationships and start telling them about yourself. I had to be careful not to suddenly grab the patient's sleeve
and not interrupt her mid-word: "What are you saying?
And I feel completely different! What did I dream about?
Listen..." Or: "What do you know about insomnia? Is this supposed to be a panic attack? Don't joke.
The one I had last time was just...".
I couldn't listen. I didn't respect the boundaries,
I was falling into transference. I didn't believe in statistics and verifying theories. The postulate: one personality - one man, it always seemed to me
too minimalistic. I had a tendency to blur the obvious, to cast doubt on irrefutable arguments - it was a habit, a perverse
brain yoga, the subtle pleasure of experiencing internal movement. Watching everyone with suspicion
19
judgment, tasting it under your tongue and finally discovering that none of it is real, only
fake and its brand fabricated. I did not want
having fixed views would be unnecessary baggage. I stood up in discussions one by one, one by one
on the other side - and I know they didn't like me for it
my interlocutors. I witnessed a strange phenomenon
that was going on in my head: the more arguments I found "for", the more I came up with
to the head of these "cons", and the more attached I became to the first ones, the more tempting they became
the latter became the latter.
How could I test others when it's difficult for me?
I had to solve every test. Personality questionnaire, survey, columns of questions and scaled
the answers seemed too difficult for me. I quickly noticed my disability, so during my studies,
as we examined each other in practice,
I gave random answers, at random.
Then strange profiles emerged - curves drawn on the coordinate axis. “You believe that
The best decision is the one that is easiest to change?
Do I believe? What decision? To change? When? What's the easiest way? “When you enter a room, do you occupy rather
a central place rather than a peripheral place?" Which room? And when? Is the room empty or are there red plush sofas along its walls? And what windows?
is there a view behind them? Question about the book: do I prefer it?

depending on what book it is and what kind of reception it is?
What a methodology! It is tacitly assumed that
A man does not know himself, but if you ask him the right clever questions, he will examine himself. He will ask himself a question and answer it himself.
He will inadvertently reveal the secret to himself
does not know anything.
And the second assumption, deadly dangerous - that
we are constant and our reactions are predictable.
Syndrome
The story of my travels is only a story of ailments. I suffer from a syndrome that is easily understandable
found in any atlas of clinical syndromes
and which - according to specialist literature
— is becoming more and more common. It is best to read the old (from the 1970s) edition of "The Clinical Syndromes", which is a kind of
syndrome encyclopedia. Moreover, it constitutes for
me a source of constant inspiration. Would anyone else dare to describe the man as a whole, in general?
and objectively? He used it with full conviction
the concept of personality? Did he take the plunge into a convincing typology? I don't think so. The concept of the syndrome fits perfectly
fits travel psychology. The syndrome is small, portable, not connected to an inert theory,
episodic. You can use it to explain something and then throw it in the trash. A single-use cognitive tool.
2 1
Mine is called Perseverative Detox Syndrome. If it were translated directly and without
flair, all that would result is that its essence
consists in the persistent return of consciousness to
certain ideas, or even compulsive
their search. It's a variation of The Mean World Syndrome, pretty well
recently described in the neuropsychological literature as a particular media infection. This
in fact, a very bourgeois affliction.
The patient spends long hours in front of the TV,
by searching with the remote control only those channels where it is suitable
the most terrible news: wars, epidemics and disasters. Fascinated by what he sees, he can no longer
look away.
The symptoms themselves are not dangerous and allow you to live peacefully if you manage to keep your distance. Does not cure
this unpleasant ailment, the science stays in it
case with the bitter realization of existence itself
syndrome. When the patient is finally scared of himself
goes to a psychiatrist's office, who tells him to take more care of his hygiene - give up coffee and alcohol, and sleep
in a well-ventilated room, work in the garden, weave or knit.
My symptom set is that I am drawn to it
to me everything that is broken, imperfect, defective,
broken. I am interested in any forms, mistakes in the work of creation, dead ends. What was supposed to be
develop, but for some reason it remained underdeveloped; or, on the contrary, it exceeded the plan.
22
Anything that deviates from the norm, that is too small or
too big, exuberant or incomplete, monstrous and disgusting. Forms that do not respect symmetry, which
they multiply, grow on the sides, bud, or
on the contrary, they reduce multiplicity to unity. I'm not interested in repeatable events, those that I work on
statistics are carefully considered, those that everyone
they celebrate with a happy, familiar smile
on faces. My sensitivity is teratological,
monstrophilic. I have a constant and tormenting belief that this is where true being shines through
surface and reveals its nature. Sudden, accidental exposure. A shameful "oops", the hem of underwear from under a carefully pleated skirt. A hideous metal skeleton suddenly emerges from under a velvet
upholstery; the eruption of a spring from a plush chair that
shamelessly exposes the illusion of all softness.
Cabinet of curiosities
I have never been a keen museum goer
art, and if it were up to me, I would gladly exchange them for cabinets of curiosities, where
what is rare and unique, bizarre and monstrous is collected and exhibited. What exists in the shadows
consciousness, and when you look there - it escapes from the field
bye. Yes, I definitely have this unfortunate syndrome. I'm not attracted to collections in city centers,
but the small ones, hospital-based, often relegated to beer23
nothing as unworthy of valued exhibition spaces
and indicating the suspicious taste of former collectors. Salamander with two tails in an oval jar,
face up, waiting for the judgment day, when all the preparations of St
The world will finally be resurrected. Dolphin kidney in formalin. Skull
sheep, pure anomaly, with double the number of eyes and ears
and muzzles, as beautiful as the image of an ancient deity
of an ambiguous nature. Human fetus decorated
with beads and with a careful calligraphy of the signature: "Fetus

— where the pathological morphology of a fetus with one head and two bodies calls into question the foundations
logic 1 = 2.1 at the end, a touching home and kitchen preparation: apples from the summer of 1848 sleeping in alcohol,
all strange, with abnormal shapes; apparently someone decided that these freaks of nature deserved it
immortality and that only what is different survives.
This is what I patiently move towards in mine
journeys, tracking down the creatures' mistakes and mishaps.
I learned to write on trains, hotels and waiting rooms. On foldable airplane tables.
I write down during dinner under the table or in the toilet.
I write in museums, on the stairs, in cafes, in a car parked on the side of the road. I'm saving for
scraps of paper, in notebooks, on postcards, on
skin of hands, on napkins, on the margins of books.
Most often they are short sentences, pictures, but sometimes
I copy fragments from newspapers. Sometimes he will seduce you
I see a figure picked out of the crowd and then I deviate from my route to follow it for a while and start a story. This is a good method; excellent
in it. Year by year, time becomes my ally, like for every woman - I became invisible, transparent. I can move like a ghost
look over people's shoulders and listen to them
arguing and watching them sleep with their heads on their backpacks, like
they talk to each other, unaware of my presence, moving only their lips, formulating words that are
I'll speak for them soon.
Seeing is knowingp
The goal of my pilgrimage is always another pilgrim.
This time it is defective, in parts.
Here, for example, bones were collected, but only those with ailments; twisted spines, ribbons of ribs
They were probably taken from equally twisted bodies, dissected, dried and painted with varnish. A small number will help you find a description of the disease
in lists that have long ceased to exist. What is she like?
because the durability of paper compared to bones?
You had to write on the bones right away.
For example, here's a femur that someone curious has
he sawed lengthwise to see what was hidden inside
